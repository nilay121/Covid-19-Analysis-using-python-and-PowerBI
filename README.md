# Covid-19-Analysis-using-python-and-PowerBI
As a task for the internship at <b>The Sparks Foundation</b>, I have created a dashboard for the analysis of the Covid'19 using PowerBI. I have used python for data cleaning and various preprocessing steps then exported the cleaned CSV to PowerBI.
<br>
### Dataset
The dataset has been provided by the <b>Sparks Foundation</b>.The original dataset covers the Covid19 data for the whole world.
<br>
I have filtered the data only for India and stored them in another csv (covid_data.csv). I have also created some custom columns which would later help
in designing the Dashboard.
